% \section{Outline}
% \emph{Not intented for the reader.}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Literature review about Temporal Segmentation (previous draft was more about classification)
%   \item Consider methods for the context of filter-methods for classification
%   \item Take a loot at 3-4 different kind of methods for change detection:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item Introduction with a lot of techniques
%       \item Explain why look at a few
%       \item CUSUM - or other more traditional methods
%       \item Density-ratio estimation
%       \item Support Vector Machines (?) - if there are more sources about this
%       \item (Dimensionality reduction) --> probably not
%       \item \emph{Not to much attention to all techniques, focus is on SVM}
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item With each method, shortly look at characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and consider applicability to accelerometer sensor data
% \end{itemize}

As described in \Cref{Chapter1}, the focus of this research is the application of temporal segmentation to accelerometer data.
This is with the assumption that explicit temporal segmentation can aid the process of temporal classification.

In recent years a lot of research has been performed to study classification of human activities, recorded by on-body sensors.
Especially since smartphones with accelerometer sensors became widely available, research has focused on recordings from these devices.

In \Cref{sec:literature_review_statistical_models} we will start with an overview of statistical models used in this field of study.
That section will act as a starting point to look at the different types, applications and methods of temporal segmentation.
\Cref{sec:literature_review_temporal_segmentation} follows the distinction made and looks at a collection of temporal segmentation and change detection methods.
It will also relate the concept of \gls{occ} to temporal segmentation and change detection.
In \Cref{sec:density-ratio} methods using density-ratio estimation of \glspl{pdf} for change detection are discussed.
The final section of this chapter, \Cref{sec:literature_review_svm}, will discuss a specific class of algorithms for \gls{occ}, namely the methods that use \glspl{svm} for the classification task.
