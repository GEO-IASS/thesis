\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Literature review about Temporal Segmentation (previous draft was more about classification)
  \item Consider methods for the context of filter-methods for classification
  \item Take a loot at 3-4 different kind of methods for change detection:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Dimensionality reduction
      \item Density-ratio estimation
      \item Support Vector Machines (?) - if there are more sources about this
      \item CUSUM - or other more traditional methods
    \end{itemize}
  \item With each method, shortly look at characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and consider applicability to accelerometer sensor data
\end{itemize}
