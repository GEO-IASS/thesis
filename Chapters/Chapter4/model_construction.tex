\section{Model Construction: Incremental SVDD}\label{sec:method_model_construction}
After the data is collected and pre-processed (or in the case of the artificial data sets: generated), we construct an online incremental sliding window model construction algorithm.
We follow the method and implementation introduced by Tax and Laskov \cite{tax2003online}, the \acrlong{isvdd} method.
This method combines the techniques of online, unsupervised and incremental learning methods with the earlier introduced \gls{oc-svm} algorithm \gls{svdd}.
The method is first initialized with a window length and then in every step a new data object is added to and the last data object is removed from the working set.

Using the following abstract form of the \gls{svm} optimization problem, the extension of the incremental \gls{svm} to the \gls{svdd} can be carried out:
\begin{equation}
  \operatorname*{max}_\mu \operatorname*{min}_{\substack{
    0 \le x \le C \\
    \vectorsym{a}^T \vectorsym{x} + b = 0}
  } : W = -\vectorsym{c}^T\vectorsym{x} + \frac{1}{2}\vectorsym{x}^T K\vectorsym{x} + \mu(\vectorsym{a}^T\vectorsym{x} + b),
\end{equation}
where $\vectorsym{c}$ and $\vectorsym{a}$ are $n \times 1$ vectors, $K$ is a $n \times n$ matrix and $b$ is a scalar.
The \gls{svdd} implementation of this abstract form is set by the parameters $\vectorsym{c}=\operatorname*{diag}(K)$, $\vectorsym{a} = \vectorsym{y}$ and $b=1$.
The procudure for the incremental version has two operations: adding and removing a data object $k$.
When a data object $k$ added, its weight $x_k$ is initially set to $0$.
In case of an object removal, the weight is forced to be $x_k=0$.
Both the operations conclude with the recalculation $\mu$ and the weights $\vectorsym{x}$ for all the objects, in order to obtain the optimal solution for the enlarged or reduced data set.
The incremental learning algorithm follows from these two operations: new data objects are added to and old data objects are removed from the working set.

The size of the initial window of data objects has a lower bound determined by the hyperparameter $C$ (Equation \ref{eq:svdd_objective}).
Because of the equality constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i = 1$ and the box constraint $0 \le x_i \le C$, the number of objects in the working set must be at least $\ceil{\frac{1}{C}}$.
