\subsection{Temporal Segmentation}\label{sec:lit_review_temporal_segmentation}
As stated by Keogh et al. \cite{keogh2001online}, key to finding solutions is the representation of the data.
Due to the nature of this research, only segmenting techniques with an on-line approach (or easy translation to one ***?***) will be considered.
Furthermore, segmentation algorithms can be distinguished in the way it processes the signal.
Here a distinction is made between periodic and non-periodic activities, using autocorrelation as a measure for self-similarity of a signal.
Many papers propose segmentation in a SWAB-manner, among which \cite{bernecker2012activity}.
Some approaches are implemented as batch, or off-line, methods, whilst others split the signal while processing it on-line.
The algorithm processes an on-line signal per sliding window and merges segments in a bottom-up approach whilst keeping the approximation error below an user-specified threshold.
The research proposes the Sliding-Window And Bottom-up (SWAB) algorithm to represent a signal as segments of linear approximations.
The task of temporal segmentation consists of splitting a time series data $M$ into $M_1 \dots M_n$ consecutive segments, where each segment bundles homogeneous data points and there is some notion of heterogeneity between segments.
This problem arises in many fields of study, among which computer vision *** refs ***, motion capture *** refs *** and data mining *** refs ***.
