\section{One-Class Support Vector Machine}\label{sec:one_class_svm}
*** Use material from blog post ***
\subsection{Support Vector Machine}
\emph{Explain classical two-class problem and workings of \gls{svm}; minimization function etc.}

\subsection{Standard One-Class SVM}
\emph{Explain workings of standard one-class svm by the method of Sch\"olkopf, \cite{scholkopf1999support}}

\subsection{Support Vector Data Description}
\emph{Explain working of \gls{svdd} by Tax and Duin, \cite{tax2004support}}

*** Maybe add section about ``Change indication'' rather than ``detection''? ***
