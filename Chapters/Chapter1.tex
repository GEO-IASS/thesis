\section{Problem statement}
*** Give context problems, means to reach (e.g. monitoring of patients,  getting conclusions over health and activity).
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Literature review}
Look into earlier application mentioned in the literature to this kind of  problems. Look for similarities in the problem and address where the  techniques used fail or are not applicable.

*** Most of the activity recognition techniques can be classified in two  different types.
Some rely on a state-space model, in which the activities to be recognized are represented in a statistical manner.
Bayesian networks, Finite State Machines and Hidden Markov Models can be considered among those.
Other techniques process the directly as a pattern recognition task, such as  Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Dynamic Time Warping, and Bayes and K-means clustering.
