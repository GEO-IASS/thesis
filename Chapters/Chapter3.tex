\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In-depth analysis on one of the methods of Chapter \ref{Chapter2}
  \item This method (e.g. Density-Ratio estimation) will be the basis for the real research
  \item Explain why this methods seems worthy and interesting
  \item Look at problems when applied to accelerometer sensor data
  \item \emph{The problems discovered here will give rise to the problem statement at the Introduction / beginning of research}
  \item Opens the possibility for own method
\end{itemize}
