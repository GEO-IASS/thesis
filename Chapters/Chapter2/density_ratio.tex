\section{Change-detection by Density-Ratio Estimation}

Formulate the problem of detecting change in the statistical framework.
Consider the probability distributions from which two consecutive segments of time series around a target time point are generated.
When the disitrubtions differ significantly the target time point is regarded as a change point.




CUSUM (cumulative sum) \cite{basseville1993detection} and GLR (generalized likelihood ratio)


The distribution over the values of time series data can be represented with a probability density function (pdf).
Two sections of a time series data can be generated with the same underlying pdf or each with a different.
