\subsection{CUSUM}
Non-Bayesian change detection algorithm (thus: no prior distribution believe available for the change time).

The CUSUM (cumulative sum) method is developed by Page \cite{page1954continuous} for the application of statistical quality control (it is also known as a control chart).

Primary for detection of mean shift.


\subsection{GLR}
Also: maximum-likelihood estimation. "When applied to a dataset and a given statistical model, it provides estimates for the model's parameters."
